# Aircraft Engine Maintenance prediction | IBM capstone project

Companies follow different maintenance programs to increase operational reliability and reduce costs. One way to do is

  * Reactive maintenance: the machine is used to its limits and repairs are performed only after machine failure.

  * Preventive maintenance: In order to prevent failure before it occurs by performing reguñar checks on their equipment.

  * Prediction maintenance: The idea is to predict when machine failure will occur and schedule maintenance right before it. Also pinpoints problems in machinery and helps to identify what parts need to be fixed.

And that is exactly what this works pretends to do.

## Predictive maintenance algorithm

### Acquire data

A triplex pump is commonly used in the oil and gas industry. The first step is to collect a large set of sensor data (temperature, flow, pressure,etc) representing healthy and faulty operation from different operating conditions. Real data.

In some cases, there is not enough data to be analyzed, so a mathematical model of the pump can be constructed and estimate its parameters from sensor data. Then,this model can be simulated with different fault states to generate failure data. Synthetic data.

### Preprocess data

Once the daata was acquired, the next step is to remove outliers and clean it up by filtering out the noise
