# Aircraft Engine Maintenance prediction | IBM capstone project

Companies follow different maintenance programs to increase operational reliability and reduce costs. One way to do is

  * Reactive maintenance: the machine is used to its limits and repairs are performed only after machine failure.

  * Preventive maintenance: In order to prevent failure before it occurs by performing regu√±ar checks on their equipment.

  * Prediction maintenance: The idea is to predict when machine failure will occur and schedule maintenance right before it. Also pinpoints problems in machinery and helps to identify what parts need to be fixed.

And that is exactly what this works pretends to do.
